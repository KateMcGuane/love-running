## Compatability
*SAMPLE*
The website was tested on three different browsers: Brave, Chrome, & Microsoft Edge. It was compatable across all three.

The following elements were tested manually on each of the browsers:
  - Internal links work correctly, & as expected.
  - External links to socials work on the browsers listed & open a new tab for each corresponding link.
  - The contact form works correctly & displays the necessary response page on execution.

## Responsiveness

The website was tested manually throughout the project development using DevTools to check for responsiveness.

The responsiveness was confirmed with [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/). The following are samples of some of the responsiveness implemented.
