Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **July 26th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Design

*SAMPLE*
The website is designed with three separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. It has an intuitive interface with clear navigation. This is emphasised with colour and imagery, allowing for quick access to facilities and respective socials.


  ### Colour Scheme

  There is a great emphasis on ...... for this website. I wanted it to reflect... <br>
  The colour scheme of the website illustrates...

  ![Hero Image](assets/images/hero.png)

  This palette holds...Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

  This palette extracts......found in the hero image. It is used primarily for defining elements such as headings, areas of importance or quick reference.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette-2.png)

  Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.


  ### Typography

  ![Name of Font](filepath/to/font/image.PNG)
*SAMPLE*
    - This font has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, looks hand-drawn and mirrors the chosen style of favicon. It is illustrative, yet has a structural integrity and readability to it. Furthermore, it effortlessly reflects what the website is about. This is primarily used for the website heading "Hobby".

  [Name of font](https://link_to_font_here)

![Name of Font](filepath/to/font/image.PNG)
*SAMPLE*
    - This is a legible, sans serif font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read. This is used for more word heavy content sections of the website.

  Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


  ### Imagery

  All images were source from [Raw Pixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/).


  ### Favicon

    Talk about favicon design choices.


  ### Wireframes

  Wireframes were created for desktop (1920px x 1080px), iPad (768px x 1024px) and iPhone 12Pro (436px x 867px).

## Features

| Features & Pages| Existing Features | Future Implementations | Screenshots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
*SAMPLE*
| Navigation Bar | - Visible on all pages. <br> - Kept white so as to remain clear. <br> - The favicon styles are refelcted in the header. <br> - There is a ...... icon to give an idea as to what the page is about. <br> - Has a toggle feature that links to each page when using smaller devices. | --- | ![Naviagtion Bar](docs/features/navigation_bar.PNG) |
| Hero Image | - Each page features a hero image of XXX. | - Experiment with more options. | ![Hero Image About Page](docs/features/hero_image_about_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Discover Page](docs/features/hero_image_discover_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Sign Up Page](docs/features/hero_image_signup_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Response Page](docs/features/hero_image_response_page.PNG) |
| Colour | - Block colours are used where there's writing so they do not get lost in the sprinkles background. | ---| ![colour About Page](docs/features/colour_about_page.PNG)  ![colour Discover Page](docs/features/colour_discover_page.PNG) ![colour Sign Up Page](docs/features/colour_signup_page.PNG) ![colour Response Page](docs/features/colour_response_page.PNG) |
| Footer | - A focal point that stands out clearly with a white background. This is carried throughout each page as it is essential to create a strong social following as the concept of the website is community-based. | - Expand footer to include contact details, T&Cs, Privacy Policy etc. | ![Footer](docs/features/footer.PNG) |
| About | General landing page that describes what the website & what it is about. | - Add an image carousel. <br> - Add a map listing all hobbies in the area. <br> - Add a preview section of reviews from former clientel. | ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/WEBSITE_NAME/PAGE_NAME.PNG)  |
| Discover | This is the main directory page. It features a gallery of the hobbies that the website is connected to (actual links to be implemented at later stage of development). They are displayed in rows of three on desktop and collapse responsively with decreasing screen size. This page illustrates what is available through the website with simple visual cues. | Once data is collected from those wanting to promote their business, club or facility it could be utilized across the website. Each hobby displayed would connect to the organisations offering those services. This would also include: <br> - Links to their socials, webpages, features and contact details. <br> - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few. This way people can find the best service to suit their essential needs. | ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/hobby_discover_page.PNG) ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/WEBSITE_NAME/PAGE_NAME.PNG)  |
| Sign Up | Features a one-way means of contact. This would meet the needs of the website on it's first phase as a relatively static website. The purpose of this feature is to collect potential customer and facilitator data. | Use the page to promote new & upcoming developments. | ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/WEBSITE_NAME/PAGE_NAME.PNG) |
| Response | - Only activated when the user clicks the 'Subscribe' button for the signup page. It is there to inform the user they have been successful with their subscription. <br> - Home button below notifcation to redirect users. | --- | ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/WEBSITE_NAME/PAGE_NAME.PNG)  |

  ### Markup

*SAMPLE*
  - First Edition: <br>
    - The general format of my markup is based on the [readme-examples](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) work by [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).

  - Second Edition: <br>
    - I formatted some of my README based off of [BookWorm](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/tree/main), again by [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).
    - I based my testing documentation off of [Animal Shelter](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova/animal_shelter/blob/main/TESTING.md#manual-testing) from my mentor, [Juliia Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova/).


  ### Code Used

  - Did you follow a video tutorial?
  - Was there a template you used?


  ### Content

  - Did you write the content yourself?
  - Did you source the content from ChatGPT?
  - Did you use another website as a reference point?
